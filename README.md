# RNN-Test
RNN-Test: Generic Adversarial Testing Framework for Recurrent Neural Network Systems

This repository provides the source code of RNN-Test, example adversarial inputs for three models and figures not listed in the paper, mainly for the reproducibility. The code space is rough now and will be maintained continously.

## Description


## Dependencies
1. For PTB language model and spell checker model
2. For DeepSpeech ASR model

## To run the models
